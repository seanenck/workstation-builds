Workstation Builds
===

Personal workstation builds for use by bootc for local deployment.
This provides a pretty simplistic way of bootstrapping a workstation
though it requires the use of an atomic spin (from fedora) the first
time so that the bundle can be built and then bootc'd into.

_This image is built and deployed locally/manually via `just`_
